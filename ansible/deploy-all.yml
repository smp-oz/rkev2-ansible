# RKE2 Kubernetes Cluster Deployment
# Automated deployment of production-ready RKE2 cluster with unified master architecture
# 
# New Architecture (Updated January 31, 2025):
# - 3 Kubernetes Masters with RKE2 (control plane) - 10.122.10.46, 10.122.11.81, 10.122.12.28
# - 3 Kubernetes Workers (data plane) - 10.122.10.83, 10.122.11.68, 10.122.12.203
# - First master (10.122.10.46) initializes the cluster, others join as additional servers
#
# After completion, use RANCHER-MANUAL-SETUP.md for manual Rancher installation
